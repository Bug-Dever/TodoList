## TodoList

Hi~ this is my first Java project: **TodoList**.

TodoList implements the CRUD operation of data.

It is based on `Spring`, `SpringMVC` and `MyBatis` framework with front-end reference to `Vue 3` + `Vite` template.

> How to run?

You can deploy the front-end code through `VSCode` to the `Node` server, the back-end code through `IDEA` to the `Tomcat` 10 + version server.
